# PH's Retirement Wave Analysis
## Reason for Analysis

With a projected 93,000 employess eligible for retirement in the next 4 years, we need to make sure that we are prepared to withstand that wave and get new people trained to fill the void that is inevitable. With some suggestions from upper-management about mentorship and what roles we need to target, we have created a visal representation of our targets.

## Analysis Results
- Approximately 50,000 retiring employees will be of a senior level.
- We only will lose 2 managers.

- Approximately 1500 employees could be considered for mentorship.
- 739 eligible mentors are senior staff.

## Analysis Summary in Response
The company is on track to handle the mass retirement. Assuming all employees retire on the day they are eligible, we are looking at having 21,209 employees retire this year, 22,857 retire next year, 23,228 retire the year after, and 23,104 retire in 4 years time. To keep up with the wave of retirement, we will want to add these numbers to our projected job growth for the upcoming 4 years.

That being said, we will want to look at augmenting our mentor program as we are going to have some very weak proportions.

Some of our mentors are going to form a smaller percentage of the retirees than others. For example, we will have 25,000 senior staff retire with 569 of those eligible to become mentors (2%) while we will have 26,000 senior engineers retire with only 169 of those eligible for mentorship roles (0.6%). All other titles will have eligible mentors that will make up anywhere from 2% to 7% of retirees.
