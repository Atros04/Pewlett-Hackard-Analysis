# PH's Retirement Wave Analysis
## Reason for Analysis

With a projected 93,000 employess eligible for retirement in the next 3 years, we need to make sure that we are prepared to withstand that wave and get new people trained to fill the void that is inevitable. With some suggestions from upper-management about mentorship and what roles we need to target, we have created a visal representation of our targets.

## Analysis Results
- Approximately 50,000 retiring employees will be of a senior level.
- We only will lose 2 managers.
- Approximately 1500 employees could be considered for mentorship.
- 739 eligible mentors are senior staff.

## Audit Summary
Commissioners, we currently are in a prescident where our democracy is evolving to meet with the demand that the last 2 years have put on this country. We need to ensure everyone's voice is heard and that no one is trying to tip the scales in anyone's favor. This script has shown in small scale that we can audit a selection of counties in the state. Since we have formatted it to be usable with new data and information, we can ramp up the data to be state-wide. This script will process all counties in national elections while also being relevant for the smaller elections. For those smaller elections, we can add sections of code to index down the city level making so the audit can be performed across the board.

This code is not just designed for elections. Since we've developed this as a counting and sorting system, we can utilize this code to better tally anything. For example, we can tally inventories at the registrar of voters. By replacing candidate names and counties with product names and brand. We also can utilize this code to better track voter turnout in regards to who votes how often. Assuming we keep the voter IDs unique to one person, we can track the IDs across all elections and see if someone skips an election. By replacing candidate information with the ID lookup, we can track when that ID votes and verify they didn't vote more than once.

These images are provided for proof of concept testing and are subject to change. For your consideration, we can take these audits and scale them for not only the state, but beyond the scope of our initial needs for anything that can be tallied.
