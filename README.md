# PH's Retirement Wave Analysis
## Reason for Analysis

With a projected 93,000 employess eligible for retirement in the next 4 years, we need to make sure that we are prepared to withstand that wave and get new people trained to fill the void that is inevitable. With some suggestions from upper-management about mentorship and what roles we need to target, we have created a visal representation of our targets.

## Analysis Results
- Approximately 50,000 retiring employees will be of a senior level.
- We only will lose 2 managers.

## Analysis Summary in Response
The company is on track to handle the mass retirement. Assuming all employees retire on the day they are eligible, we are looking at having 21,209 employees retire this year, 22,857 retire next year, 23,228 retire the year after, and 23,104 retire in 4 years time. To keep up with the wave of retirement, we will want to add these numbers to our projected job growth for the upcoming 4 years.

That being said, we will want to look at augmenting our mentor program as we are going to have some very weak proportions.
